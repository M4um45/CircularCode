Hello everyone,

I'm excited to share the code I developed for my computational physics project, focusing on modeling the propagation of waves in a circular membrane. 
The entire project is implemented using centered finite difference methods. 

Note: In all codes, you have the possibility to animate the wave propagation.

NormalModes Code:
The code-named NormalModes generates the normal modes of a circular membrane with fixed boundary conditions. 
This serves as a foundational piece for understanding the inherent behavior of the system.

Fourier Code:
Fourier analysis is employed in the Fourier code to perform a Fourier Transformation, revealing the composition of modes. 
This becomes particularly insightful when exploring different forcing terms or analyzing wave propagation with arbitrary frequencies.

Forcing Terms:
The introduction of forcing terms in the code allows for the exploration of how different terms impact wave propagation. 
You can easily observe these changes by utilizing the Fourier code, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the system's response.

Freeboundary and Drag Codes:
Two additional codes, namely Freeboundary and Drag, are provided to facilitate the study of wave propagation under specific conditions.
The Freeboundary code considers free boundary conditions, while the Drag code incorporates the effect of air drag forces on wave propagation. 
These codes offer a more nuanced understanding of the system in real-world scenarios.

Feel free to explore and modify these codes to suit your specific needs. 
They are designed to provide a robust framework for studying wave dynamics in a circular membrane, offering a solid foundation for computational physics analysis.
